# Lasso And Ridge

Ridge and Lasso regression are some of the simple techniques to reduce model complexity and prevent over-fitting which may result from simple linear regression.

-Regularization (L2)
Ridge : In ridge regression, the cost function is altered by adding a penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of the coefficients.

-Regularization (L1)
Lasso : The only difference is instead of taking the square of the coefficients, magnitudes are taken into account. This type of regularization (L1) can lead to zero coefficients i.e. some of the features are completely neglected for the evaluation of output. So Lasso regression not only helps in reducing over-fitting but it can help us in feature selection
